# Finite-difference-method-with-MATLAB
In this repository different applications of Finite Difference Method have been used for solving real problems. Most of the numerical schemes are implicit. Thomas method has been used for solving the linear algebraic systems obtained after the discretization. Its implementation has been given in the m-file Progon.m.
